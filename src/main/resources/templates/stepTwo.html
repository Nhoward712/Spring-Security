            <p>Now that we have our ingredients put together, we can start turning them into something that you will be proud to
                serve for your next meal. The first thing we need to do is remove the skins off your tomatoes.  If you are using
                canned tomatoes, skip this first step.  To skin our tomatoes, bring four quarts of water to a boil in your large
                stock pot.  While this is coming to a boil, gather five and a half pounds of tomatoes.  With the tip of a sharp
                knife, cut an “X” pattern just through the skin on bottom end opposite of the stem.  This will help later.</p><br>
            <p>We will also need to create an ice bath to cool the tomatoes once they come out of the boiling water.  Use the
                large bowl and fill it with ice and water.  Just remember that you will be adding the tomatoes to it, so make
                sure it is not too full.</p><br>
            <p>Once the water in the pot has come to a boil, add two or three tomatoes to the water.
                If we add them all at once, the water will cool down too much and the skins won’t come off properly.  After the
                tomatoes have boiled for 20 seconds, check one to see if the skin peels away from the meat easily starting from
                the “X” that you had cut in them earlier.  If so, place them immediately in the ice water bath.  Repeat this
                process until all of the tomatoes are cooked.</p><br>
            <p>Once all the tomatoes have chilled, peel all of the skins off and
                discard the skins.  After all the tomatoes have been peeled, take them to the cutting board and cut them into
                quarters.  The shape doesn’t matter much as long as all the pieces are approximately the same size.  Empty the
                ice bath bowl and use it to store the cut tomatoes until needed again.  Collect any juices created by cutting
                the tomatoes and put into the bowl as well.  Take the stock pot and wash it right away because we will need it
                for the next step.   </p>
